# Discord-Bot 

Code for learning the capabilities of the Discord API and discord.py.
<br> Implemented through silly#5163

## Notes
- This bot is equipt to run locally, preferably in a single server, for testing purposes.
- As of ``February 2024``, there is no intention to publicly host this bot. Its code is intended as a learning experience for those new to Python / discord.py.
- Many commands produce default responses, which can be combined with other features to provide greater utility.
- **Usage**: you are free to use this code as seen fit, though I reccomend not in deployment!

## Implemented Features
**Prefix Commands**
- ``prefix`` ``command`` format, ex: ``!kick``
- Does not support autocompletion
- Does not require syncing with Discord (instantly available upon bot startup)

**Slash Commands (Application Commands)**
- ``/`` ``command`` format, ex: ``/kick``
- Supports multiple (optional or not) inputs in a single command call
- Supports dynamic lists of available inputs
- Best suited for avoiding formatting / command call errors

**Embeds**
- Extends UI capabilities
- Effective for increasing accessibility / improving text contrast
- Supports sub-headings, images, and links
- [Formatting site used](https://plainenglish.io/blog/send-an-embed-with-a-discord-bot-in-python)
